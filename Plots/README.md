# Plots


# 1) Layout of folders:

There are the following subfolders within each folder:


a) .csv -- contains the data required for plotting.

b) .vsz -- a software file with a plotting-specific format.

c) .png -- the generated plot.


# 2) Steps:

1) You need to install "Veusz" software on your system.

2) Store the data in the .csv file.

3) Open the .vsz file and import the .csv file.

4) Once the plot has been edited to your desire, export it as a png file.
