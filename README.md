# MaMoRL



# 1) Setup

You can find the required dependencies to run all the codes in the file "Required_Dependencies.txt".

To run code, import entire folder into IDE. PyCharm is one option. Import as a project 


# 2) Hardware Requirements:

Most of the experiments are run on OS Big Sur with 2.4 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i5 Processor and 16 GB RAM.

 Experiments involving exact MaMoRL are run on a 64-bit OS server with 3.5 GHz 11th Gen Intel Core i9 and 128 GB RAM.


# 3) Layout of folders

There are two folders:

1. Codes : Contains different folders for each algorithm.
2. Plots : Contains all the plots and their source file even the ones that are not presented in the draft.

The Codes folder contains the following subfolders:

    a) Exact Model (MaMoRL)

    b) Approx Model (Approx-MaMoRL)

    c) Approx-MaMoRL with Partial Knowledge

    d) Baseline-1

    e) Baseline-2

    f) Neural Network Model  (NN-Approx-MaMoRL)

    g) Random Walk Baseline


# 4) Remarks

** Each folder has a README file with a more comprehensive explanation **
